SageTV_Service_Info=About SageTV Service\n----------------------------\nRunning SageTV as a service means that the recording function is separated  from the playback function and user interface.\n\nThis means that:\n* The service is automatically started (and optionally restarted) by Windows\n* You do not have to be logged in for SageTV to be recording something.\n* Exiting the User interface does not interrupt recordings\n\nSee the Installation and Setup section of the manual for more details about service mode.\n\nOptions:\n------------\n\nRun Service as User/Change User\n-------------------------------------\n\nThis determines which Windows user account is used to run the service.\n\nThe LocalSystem user is a special account with Administrator rights, but which cannot access network drives.\nIf you have any media storage on network drives, then you must run SageTV as a real user.\nNote that real users must have a password defined to run services,  and note that the media directories must be both readable and writeable to this user account.\n\nTo create a user account:\nStart->Settings->Control Panel->User Accounts\n\n\nEnable Service Recovery:\n-----------------------------\n\nShould the service crash, Windows can restart it automatically if this option is checked.\n\nMore Options\n-----------------\n\nFor more service options see:\n\nStart->Settings->Control Panel->Aministrative Tools->Services\n\nRight-click SageTV in the list and select Properties
